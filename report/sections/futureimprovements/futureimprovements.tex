\textbf{Image Processing Hardware:}\\
Image or video processing filters, which consume much more area on the \gls{fpga} on the one hand and have a much higher processing effort on the other hand, would be a very suitable application for a partial reconfigurable \gls{iot} device. At the Vivado IP Catalog, there are some cores, which would fit requirements for an efficient image and video processing purpose. These cores uses a AXI-Stream interface for the connection to the rest of the fabric. At this laboratory project these cores couldn't be used, because there was no license for generating a bitstream, which includes these cores, provided.
