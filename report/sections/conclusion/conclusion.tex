Generally we showed in our work, that \gls{dpr} might be useful method for exchanging different application, based on hardware accelerators, in \gls{iot} devices. Exchanging different filters for image or video processing applications are just one useful group of applications, in which \gls{dpr} can be an efficient method, regarding the \gls{fpga} resources.  Reconfigure different kind of cryptographic algorithm or functionalities are as well an useful application for an exchangeable \gls{dpr} implementation. Finally there is an widely spread demand on implementing \gls{iot} devices, which can exchange some specific hardware blocks for different aims during runtime in a simple download process.
