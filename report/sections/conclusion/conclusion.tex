In general, we have shown in our work that \gls{dpr} can be a useful method to exchange various applications based on hardware accelerators in \gls{iot} devices. Exchanging different filters for image or video processing applications is only one useful application whre \gls{dpr} can be an efficient method in terms of the \gls{fpga} resources.  Replacing different kind of cryptographic algorithms or functionalities are as well an useful application for an exchangeable \gls{dpr} implementation. Finally there is an widely spread demand on implementing \gls{iot} devices, which can exchange some specific hardware blocks for different aims during runtime in a simple download process.
