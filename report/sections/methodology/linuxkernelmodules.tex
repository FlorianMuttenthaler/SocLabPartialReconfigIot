\textbf{Image Filter Driver:}\\
The Image Filter Linux Kernel driver writes the to process raw RGB data to an address of the AXI-Lite bus, which belongs to the defined filter logic. Afterwards the filter data is read by the driver by reading from an other address. The raw RGB data of an image is communicated to the device driver by writing data streams with the related data values. Finally the modified data is read by reading an output data stream.\\
